## 💡 The Problem
Most beginner investors think owning multiple stocks equals diversification. However, concentrated sector exposure creates hidden risks that only become apparent during market downturns. In 2022, tech-heavy portfolios lost 30-40% while balanced portfolios dropped only 15-20%.

## ✨ Features
- **AI-Powered Risk Analysis** - Intelligent narratives explaining portfolio risks in plain English
- **Sector Concentration Breakdown** - Visual pie chart showing allocation across 12+ sectors
- **Risk Scoring System** - 0-100 diversification score with clear risk levels (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH)
- **Historical Context** - Real market examples showing impact of concentration risk
- **Actionable Recommendations** - Specific suggestions for rebalancing portfolios
- **Sample Portfolios** - Pre-loaded examples (Tech Growth, Balanced, Dividend Income)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Next.js 14 (App Router), React 18, TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Charts:** Recharts for interactive data visualization
- **AI:** Intelligent risk analysis engine with context-aware content generation
- **Deployment:** Vercel with automated CI/CD from GitHub
- **Architecture:** Fully serverless, edge-optimized for global performance

## 📊 How It Works
1. User selects or inputs a portfolio
2. System calculates sector concentration and diversification metrics
3. AI engine generates personalized risk narrative based on:
   - Sector allocation percentages
   - Historical market patterns
   - Portfolio-specific risk factors
4. Results displayed with visual charts and actionable insights

## 🏗️ Architecture Decisions
- **Client-side first approach** for instant load times and zero backend costs
- **Serverless API routes** for AI analysis generation
- **Static site generation** for optimal performance
- **Scalable to 10,000+ users** on free tier with room to grow
